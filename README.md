## I'm moving from GitHub

GitHub [now advertises itself](https://web.archive.org/web/20231216105815/https://github.com/) as an "AI-powered developer platform". On this day [just two years ago](https://web.archive.org/web/20211216000728/https://github.com/), it advertised itself as literally everything I want in a Git forge:

- Public code hosting powered by Git,
- Package registry,
- An excellent code diffing view in Pull Requests,
- Dead simple CI/CD integration,
- and a few other nice-to-haves.

I don't have well-enough informed opinions on "AI" to take issue with GitHub integrating and marketing it everywhere, though I do have some concerns best expressed in a blog post or something. My issue lately is that GitHub seems to have shifted its focus: "Just as GitHub was founded on Git, today we are re-founded on Copilot." ([Thomas Dohmke](https://web.archive.org/web/20231215023455/https://github.blog/2023-11-08-universe-2023-copilot-transforms-github-into-the-ai-powered-developer-platform/), 8 Nov 2023) That's cringe, IMO.

Also, despite GitHub's role in popularizing open-source, GitHub's website is not itself open-source. Seems shady, in principle.

Anyway, I'm moving most of my code to [my own Forgejo instance](https://git.average.name). Anyone with an account on GitHub, GitLab, or Codeberg should, in theory, be able to make an account there to contribute to any of my code, if you want. Star, file issues, submit pull requests, whatever! Same as GitHub. Code that already exists here I plan to keep here as read-only code mirrors.

I just want to write useful software, with the help of anyone who wants to help. I don't need Microsoft's AI toys taking the fun out of it for me.
